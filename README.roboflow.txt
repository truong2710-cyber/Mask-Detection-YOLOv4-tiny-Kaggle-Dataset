* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 61 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random shear of between -5째 to +5째 horizontally and -5째 to +5째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.25 pixels
